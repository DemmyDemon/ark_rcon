A very simple RCON client specifically made for ARK: Survival Evolved.

With little modification, it should work fine with almost anything that uses
Valve's RCON protocol. This was all based on my earlier work with Minecraft, and
I only had to make minor adjustments.

It will poll for new chat at regular intervals, and keep a list of online
players updated to notify you when someone comes or goes.

Anything you type in will be sent to the server, except two commands, ? and !:
A single question mark will tell you when ark_rcon.pl last heard from the
server.
Prefix a line with ! as a shorthand for "serverchat".
For example...
!Good morning everyone
...will actually send "serverchat Good morning everyone" to the server.

If you run the script from the same box the server is on, and RCON is on Valve's
default RCON port, you only have to specify the password.

$ ./ark_rcon.pl --password WhateverYourAdminPasswordIs

NOTE:  Your password will be visible to anyone that can list processes on that
system. You might not want this.
I will possibly add some kind of configuration file to work around this problem,
or maybe allow you to specify the password interactively. Dunno. Suggestions and
patches are very welcome.

If you don't want to run it interactively, but just want to throw commands at
the server, you can do it like so:
$ ./ark_rcon.pl --password somePassword  --command saveworld
You can, of course, issue as many --command arguments as you want.
